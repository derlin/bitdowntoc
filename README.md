# BitDownToc

![BitDownToc](https://github.com/derlin/bitdowntoc/raw/main/src/jsMain/resources/og-bitdowntoc.png)

BitDownToc adds a table of contents (TOC) to your Markdown files, either online or from the command line.
It supports **Gitlab** and **GitHub** styles, and can generate anchors to comply with **Bitbucket Server**
(and its lack of proper markdown support), **https://dev.to** and more.

Thanks to small comments (in HTML or liquid tags), it can also detect previously generated TOC,
so you can run it every time you change your README without worries.

It supports English, French, and most **Latin languages**, but not Cyrillic or Chinese!

## Usage

### Online

Go to https://derlin.github.io/bitdowntoc !

### From the command line

The **JVM jar** can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/derlin/bitdowntoc/releases).
If you want the latest version, check the [nightly release](https://github.com/derlin/bitdowntoc/releases/nightly).

Native executables for Linux, Mac and Windows are available for releases only.
See [About native executables](#about-native-executables) for more info.

Once you have a jar, run:
```bash
# BitBucket Server
java -jar bitdowntoc-jvm-*.jar readme.md --inplace
# GitLab
java -jar bitdowntoc-jvm-*.jar --no-anchors readme.md --inplace
# GitHub
java -jar bitdowntoc-jvm-*.jar --no-anchors --no-concat-spaces readme.md --inplace
```
(If you are using a native executable, replace `java -jar bitdowntoc-jvm-*.jar` with `<path/to/executable>`).

The tool will output the transformed file depending on the following options (mutually exclusive):

* default: output to stdout;
* `-i`/`--inplace`: replace input file;
* `-o`/`--output`: output to the specified file.

**IMPORTANT**: do not use bash redirects with the same file (input = output), it won't work as you expect!

If you have a doubt, run BitDownToc with `-h` or `--help`:
```text

  --oneshot / --no-oneshot         Whether to add comments so this tool can

### About native executables

Native executables are attached to each release.

**Linux**

On Linux, you may just have to run `chmod +x` before use.

**Mac**

On Mac, you need to run `chmod +x` and then execute the script once.
It will be blocked, but you can allow it anyway by going to *System Preferences* > *Security* and pressing "Allow Anyway".
Once done, re-execute BitDownToc and click "Open" on the popup.
You are good to go.

*Windows*

On Windows, right-click on the executable and press *Properties*.
In the general tab under *Security* at the bottom, tick "Unblock".
You can now execute it in the CMD. Note that it may take a while to launch, but only the first time ;)

## TOC flavors (profiles)

This tool should work properly for GitLab, GitHub, BitBucket Server, and dev.to.
There is no support for BitBucket.org, (which prefixes anchor links with `#markdown-header-`),
as the latter can autogenerate TOCs using the `[TOC]` annotation.
Simply choose your flavor using the profile option (`-p`/`--profile`).

In case you are interested, here are the relevant option differences:

* *BitBucket Server* → generate anchors
* *GitLab* → concat spaces, do not generate anchors
* *GitHub* → do not concat spaces, do not generate anchors
* *dev.to* → generate anchors, comment style = liquid

More platforms are supported while not having a dedicated profile. For example:

* *hashnode* → concat spaces, do not generate anchors, anchors prefix = `heading-`

Note that if you render your Markdown using another processor, the *generate anchors* option is the way to go
(*BitBucket Server* profile).
Since the anchors are manually added to the markdown, the TOC will work as long as `<a>` tags with a `name` parameter
are supported. If you are working with a platform supporting liquid tags (e.g. forem), use *dev.to* instead.

## TOC placement

You can control where the table of content will be inserted by adding the marker (on its own line):
```text
[TOC]
```

Note that headers above the marker will be ignored. The option "*trim toc*" (turned on by default) means that if
you have e.g. only level-2 headers below the marker, the TOC will be indented as if those were level 1 headers.

## About the code

### Motivation

I got the motivation from the lack of existing tools supporting **BitBucket Server**.
As of version 6, the BitBucket processor doesn't insert any ID or name to the HTML headers generated from markdown, meaning there is no way
of targeting a specific header without manually adding an anchor of the form:
```html
<a name="some-heading"></a>
```

I found [this blog](https://rderik.com/blog/generate-table-of-contents-with-anchors-for-markdown-file-vim-plugin/)
mentioning a Vim plugin doing it for you, but this requires Vim (obviously) and the anchors support lives in a
specific branch that is unlikely to be maintained.

I am quite fond of [GitHub Wiki TOC generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/)
(you should see the inspiration here), and wanted something similar but more flexible
(not only targeting GitHub and supporting symbols and diacritics).


### Kotlin all the way!

This project was also a great way to play with Kotlin MPP (Multi-Platform Projects).

The code is split between:
* a common module handling the TOC generation, and defining the default options;
* a JVM module with a [Clikt](https://ajalt.github.io/clikt/) CLI;
* a JS module that is imported into a static HTML page.

Tests are implemented in the common module, with one exception: some additional tests are located in the JVM module,
because I wanted to load test files and reading files is not supported in common...

### Build and run

To build the project, use the custom target `bitdowntoc`, which will produce the JVM fat jar and copy the compiled
js scripts into the directory `html/scripts`:
```bash
./gradlew bitdowntoc
```
The `html` folder can then be deployed as a static site.


To run tests, use `check` or `allTests`:
```bash
./gradlew allTests
```
